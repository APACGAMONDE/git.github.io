## Developer Spotlight: Sergey Organov

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I'm a software engineer and system architect at JAVAD GNSS, working in its
  Moscow Research Center, in Russia. We design (and manufacture) high-end
  GNSS receivers, both hardware and software. Design and implementation of
  receivers firmware is my primary job for about 25 years already. I'm
  also responsible for the development tools our team is using, and that's
  where GNU/Linux and then Git come to the picture.

  Graduated from "Moscow Engineering Physics Institute" back in 1989 and
  qualified in "Experimental Methods in Nuclear Physics", I was always
  interested in computing. I then worked for about 10 years in "Kurchatov
  Institute" in the field of computer modeling of nuclear radiation and
  detectors, as well as in advanced processing of experimental results.
  Then a few years later started to work for JAVAD as well, in parallel.
  Then, a few more years later, left Kurchatov and entirely focused on
  working for JAVAD full-time which is my current job.

  Real-time embedded applications, also using Linux on the targets, is my
  primary field of expertise nowadays.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  I didn't contribute much. I'd name the method of rebasing of merge
  commits, that has been [covered in the Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2018/04/18/edition-38#general)
  some time ago, as the most important one.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  Right now I'm working on `--diff-merges` options for `git log`. The
  original stimulus was very surprising output of `git log -p -m` that
  made me mad the first time I encountered it. After finishing initial
  implementation of the `--diff-merges` options, I now aim at finally giving
  `git log -m` natural meaning of printing the diff for merge commits with
  respect to the first parent only.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  Actually, I have 2 favorites:

  1. Designing support for explicit commits grouping, somewhat similar to
  grouping objects in graphical editors, likely implemented as a container
  commit capturing particular part of the DAG. It'd be then seen as a
  single commit by default, unless user specifically asks to look inside.
  If we had it, our typical history would be more linear, feature branches
  essentially becoming single (group) commits, that'd make history simpler
  to traverse and to reason about.

  Right now the only poor-man estimate for that is a branch that is merged
  back to its origin (the true-non-evil merge, as I call it), that brings
  history that looks like a sequence of bubbles, but it lacks direct
  support that specific grouping feature would have.

  2. Designing new history editor that will aim at being ultimate
  replacement for both `git rebase` and `git cherry-pick` that are
  essentially the same thing at fundamental level. As useful as these
  existing features are, they have wide opportunities for improvements
  that apparently don't fit into the current design, and their history of
  incremental adaptations to different needs made quite a mess of them.

  Covering all the functionality of rebase and cherry-pick, the two most
  important new features I'd like to see are:

  - Ensuring, by design, one of the primary features of any reasonable
  editing tool: carefully preserve the content if no actual editing has
  been made or requested. This should be ensured even if the tool is
  forced to do the full job of re-creating the history according to the
  instructions. I.e., the cycle: load/mark-as-modified/save should bring
  the original result by default.

  - Better replacement for todo lists. Carefully designed format for
  describing DAG in a text form convenient for humans and for editing with
  text editor, with simple yet strictly defined syntax and semantics,
  preferably supporting generic programming language features. For
  example, it could be based on some existing language, say, Tcl. Yet it
  should take the best features of the current format and look familiar
  enough to be immediately useful without significant learning cycle.

  [That said, do we need two teams of expert developers for that, or one
  would suffice, I wonder?]

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  Support for octopus merges. Multiple (back) references could then be
  reused for more useful things, like keeping history of rebasing, and/or
  for commits grouping (see above).

* If you could add something to Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  I'd add a simple model behind Git command-line options, so that their
  design came from the model rather than entirely from the use-cases, as
  it happens to be now. It'd play similar positive role in UI design as
  Git core data model plays in the features design.

  Then, I sometimes think about addition of single NULL-commit, the
  ultimate parent of all the Git commits all over the world. I'm not sure
  it has enough value in simplifying corner cases in git implementation,
  but it fits so nice into the elegant Git data model!

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?

  Emacs and the Magit, its interface to Git, in particular, as well as a
  few parts of Emacs generic VC interface that features Git among others.
  The Magit got to the point already where I rarely find myself using Git
  command-line directly, and then mostly for some batch-processing, or on
  hosts where Emacs is not readily available.
