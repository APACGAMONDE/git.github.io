### General

* [GSoC 2020 Students and Projects](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAP8UFD1iBxiOZ_OA4DbMF9Kx2UHL15TPygoX6x-JrDGuReG1Vw@mail.gmail.com/)

  The following three students have been officially accepted to work on Git
  as part of the [GSoC (Google Summer of Code) 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/):

  - Abhishek Kumar will work on
    [Implement Generation Number v2](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6140278689234944).
    He will be co-mentored by Jakub Narebski and Derrick Stolee.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200326101520.GA19326@Abhishek-Arch/)
    and [blog](https://abhishekkumar2718.github.io/blog).

  - Hariom Verma  will work on
    [Unify ref-filter formats with other --pretty formats](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4593212745842688).
    He  will be co-mentored by Heba Waly and Christian Couder.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+CkUQ966swTrR7D2vxgQ2ZA3E=Le=u8yvEAopOsphoCWGgDeg@mail.gmail.com/)
    and [blog](https://harry-hov.github.io/blogs/posts/).

  - Shourya Shukla will work on
    [Convert submodule to builtin](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6451304047575040).
    He will be co-mentored by Kaartic Sivaraam and Christian Couder.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200325185053.10274-1-shouryashukla.oo@gmail.com/)
    and [blog](https://shouryashukla.blogspot.com/).

  It will be the 13th Summer that the Git project will mentor students
  as part of the GSoC. Shourya, Hariom and Abhishek will be the 30th,
  31st and 32nd students mentored since 2007 when Git started
  participating in the GSoC.

  It will be the 16th year of the GSoC, but unfortunately because of
  the current sanitary situation in the world, there will be no GSoC
  Mentor Summit, and no swag will be sent to participants this year.
