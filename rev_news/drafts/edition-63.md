## Discussions

### General

* [GSoC 2020 Students and Projects](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAP8UFD1iBxiOZ_OA4DbMF9Kx2UHL15TPygoX6x-JrDGuReG1Vw@mail.gmail.com/)

  The following three students have been officially accepted to work on Git
  as part of the [GSoC (Google Summer of Code) 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/):

  - Abhishek Kumar will work on
    [Implement Generation Number v2](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6140278689234944).
    He will be co-mentored by Jakub Narebski and Derrick Stolee.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200326101520.GA19326@Abhishek-Arch/)
    and [blog](https://abhishekkumar2718.github.io/blog).

  - Hariom Verma  will work on
    [Unify ref-filter formats with other --pretty formats](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4593212745842688).
    He  will be co-mentored by Heba Waly and Christian Couder.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+CkUQ966swTrR7D2vxgQ2ZA3E=Le=u8yvEAopOsphoCWGgDeg@mail.gmail.com/)
    and [blog](https://harry-hov.github.io/blogs/posts/).

  - Shourya Shukla will work on
    [Convert submodule to builtin](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6451304047575040).
    He will be co-mentored by Kaartic Sivaraam and Christian Couder.
    More information is available on his
    [proposal](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200325185053.10274-1-shouryashukla.oo@gmail.com/)
    and [blog](https://shouryashukla.blogspot.com/).

  It will be the 13th Summer that the Git project will mentor students
  as part of the GSoC. Shourya, Hariom and Abhishek will be the 30th,
  31st and 32nd students mentored since 2007 when Git started
  participating in the GSoC.

  It will be the 16th year of the GSoC, but unfortunately because of
  the current sanitary situation in the world, there will be no GSoC
  Mentor Summit, and no swag will be sent to participants this year.

### Reviews

* [remote.c: fix handling of push:remote_ref](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200228172455.1734888-1-damien.olivier.robert+git@gmail.com/)

  Last February Damien Robert sent a patch to change how
  'ref-filter.c' interprets `%(push:remoteref)`.

  'ref-filter.c' is some internal API that formats information about
  Git refs or Git objects. It's used by commands like `git branch` and
  `git for-each-ref`.

  The issue Damien wanted to fix was that 'ref-filter.c' didn't take
  into account the [`push.default` config option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-pushdefault)
  which is used when no refspec is specified for the push.

  Peff, alias Jeff King, replied to Damien, and made it clear that it
  was about taking `push.default` into account. He also found that
  Damien's patch wouldn't work in the case where `push.default` is set
  to `upstream` and a branch has been set to track a specific branch
  different than the default one.

  Peff then commented on the code and asked for some tests, saying
  that the current tests were not covering this case and that they
  would wrongly fail if Damien's patch was applied.

  Damien replied to Peff agreeing about the `upstream` case and to add
  more tests. He found that his initial code wouldn't work when
  `push.default` is set to `nothing` too.

  Peff and Damien discussed a bit more some details of the possible
  changes in the code, while Peff proposed a preparatory patch to
  clean up the current code before Damien's changes. Then Damien sent
  a [version 2](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200303161223.1870298-1-damien.olivier.robert+git@gmail.com/)
  of his patch along with Peff's preparatory patch.

  The version 2 handled all push.default cases and added tests for
  them, but Junion Hamano, the Git maintainer, suggested improvements
  in the commit message of the preparatory patch. Peff suggested
  improvements of his own but agreed with Junio's suggestion too.

  Meanwhile Damien found issues in version 2 of his own patch, and
  separately Junio commented on it and suggested some
  improvements. Damien and Junio soon agreed, and then Damien sent a
  [version 3](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200312164558.2388589-1-damien.olivier.robert+git@gmail.com/)
  of his patch. This version contained only Damien's patch, as Peff's
  patch was merged separately.

  Peff found a memory leak around Damien's patch, but the leak was
  already there before his patch. Peff also suggested small
  improvements to the tests, and eventually sent his own version of
  Damien's patch for him to "to try it out or hack on it further".

  Damien found an issue in Peff's patch though, and, after improving
  the tests in his patch, others existing issues in the current code
  in case of a triangular workflow. Peff commented that these issues
  could be left for a separate fix though.

  Damien then sent a
  [version 6](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200406175648.25737-1-damien.olivier.robert+git@gmail.com/)
  of his patch, though the title in the cover letter mistakenly
  contains "v4", saying version 4 and version 5 were intermediate
  versions he made but did not send to the mailing list.

  This version had a preparatory patch to fix the triangular workflow
  issues Damien had found, as well as his updated patch with tests for
  both his fixes in this patch and the triangular workflow fixes. But
  this version was marked as RFC as the first patch was not very
  polished.

  This led to some [release confusion](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200416211208.xqnnrkvcl2jw3ejr@doriath/)
  as Junio then had merged the 2 patches to the `next` branch, while
  Damien had sent a
  [version 8](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200416150355.635436-1-damien.olivier.robert+git@gmail.com/)
  that contains only his patch without the triangular workflow fixes
  and test cases.

  This last version is now merged in the `pu` branch, and will is
  likely to find its way to `master`, while hopefully the fixes
  related to triangular workflows will be resent separately.
