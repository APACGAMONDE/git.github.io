## Discussions


### General

* [Git Merge 2020 conference](https://git-merge.com/)

  The Git Merge conference happened on March 4, 2020 in Los
  Angeles. It was organized by GitHub and sponsored by GitHub, GitLab
  and the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

  Over 300 people attended. Some people didn't attend, and some talks
  had to be changed at the last minute due to coronavirus related
  reasons.

  On the wall [a big timeline](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP764-lYtgUakk-4Kr_Njh6S3GZE0BqdU8V_3j63RyhTygxNR12oO3mY5gSJdSGGA/photo/AF1QipPDidUvdLbTsS9DJKJlAVQ-PEV5zP1MZ4NIkd-x)
  mentioned some important events in Git history.

  There was a party in the evening with
  [a big cake dedicated to Git's 15th anniversary](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP764-lYtgUakk-4Kr_Njh6S3GZE0BqdU8V_3j63RyhTygxNR12oO3mY5gSJdSGGA/photo/AF1QipOXskul_osttaPQuOHkR1wAQQdOJb4j89VO3ipn).

* [Git Contributor Summit](https://lore.kernel.org/git/AC2EB721-2979-43FD-922D-C5076A57F24B@jramsay.com.au/)

  The Git Contributor Summit happened on March 5, 2020 in Los Angeles,
  the day after the Git Merge conference. The event was also organized
  by GitHub.

  There were 26 people attending physically and 5 people attending
  remotely.

  As usual it was an unconference where people wrote topics on a
  whiteboard during the breakfast and then voted on them by putting a
  tick-mark on the board. The topics were then discussed during the
  day roughly from the most voted on to the less voted on.

  [Notes](https://lore.kernel.org/git/AC2EB721-2979-43FD-922D-C5076A57F24B@jramsay.com.au/)
  have been taken collaboratively and sent to the mailing list
  afterwards.

* [AGit-Flow and git-repo](https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/) (*written by Jiang Xin*)

  [AGit-Flow and git-repo](https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/)
  is a blog post on a missing speech from Git
  Merge 2020. Jiang Xin, a developer at Alibaba China, had planned to
  speak at the Git Merge 2020 conference, but canceled his flight due
  to a coronavirus outbreak in China. He wrote this blog post about the
  topic he wanted to present at the conference.

  In this blog post, he introduces a centralized workflow (named AGit-Flow)
  implemented at Alibaba, and an Open Source command-line tool "git-repo",
  which is hosted on GitHub:
  [https://github.com/alibaba/git-repo-go](https://github.com/alibaba/git-repo-go).
  The tool is not bound to a single protocol or a single server. It is
  extensible and can run on Gerrit, AGit-Flow or other compatible protocols.

  The implementation of AGit-Flow has been contributed to
  [the Git mailing list](https://public-inbox.org/git/20200304113312.34229-1-zhiyou.jx@alibaba-inc.com/),
  and this feature is under code review. Junio stated that the proposed name of
  the new hook was inappropriate. Therefore, after a code review of these
  patches, expect some updates on the blog post.
