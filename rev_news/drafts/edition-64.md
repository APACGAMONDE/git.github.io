## Other News

__Various__

* Eric Wong, the developer of [public-inbox.org](https://public-inbox.org/README.html),
  [implemented a read-only IMAP/IMAPS server](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200610184147.GA1887@dcvr/),
  so that a Git mailing list archive can now be accessed through 8 IMAP
  mailboxes sliced into ~50K messages to not overload clients.

* Matheus Tavares, who was a [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
  student [last year](https://matheustavares.gitlab.io/gsoc/), has been
  hired as a freelancer by Amazon to improve Git
  performance. Congratulations to him!
